This was a project from a discipline in UFRJ to classificate black and white surface images from Venus with respect to the presence of vulcanoes or not.

The project trained and tested 5 convolutional neural networks to perform the classification. Chart results for accuracy and precision can be found in the end of the colab notebook.
